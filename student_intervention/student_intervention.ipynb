    "#1) K-Nearest Neighbors<br>\n",
    "    KNN has been successfully applied to Bioinformatics problems such as breast cancer diagnosis. [7] KNN is a relatively simple algorithm, making the results easy to interpret and communicate your results. Being a non-parametric method, it is often successful in classification situations where the decision boundary is very irregular. [9] As an instance based learning model, all of the data is stored in memory. Learning is slow, but querying is fast. The optimal choice of the value k is highly data-dependent: in general a larger k suppresses the effects of noise, but makes the classification boundaries less distinct. For high-dimensional parameter spaces, this method becomes less effective due to the so-called “curse of dimensionality”. [9] KNN makes no assumptions about the distribution of the data, or the shape of the decision boundary. \n",
    "\n",
    "#2) Support Vector Machines (SVM)<br>\n",
    "    SVMs have been successfully applied to Computer Vision problems such as facial expression classification. [5] SVMs are effective in high dimensional spaces and still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples. It uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient. SVMs are versatile, using different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.[6] If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, the method is likely to give poor performance. SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation.[6] SVMs also don't work well in large datasets, as the training time is cubic in relation to the size of the dataset. SVMs don't work very well when the data is not linearly separable. An SVM would be a good candidate for this problem, since the size of the dataset is not too large and the features are not independent of one another, making for data that linearly separable. \n",
    "\n",
    "#3) Random Forest (Ensemble Method)<br>\n",
    "    RF has been successfully applied to Bioinformatics problems such as diabetic retinopathy classification analyses. [4] RF is one of the most accurate and widely applicable supervised learning models. It is the closet thing to silver bullet when it comes to machine learning. RF is very fast to train, but quite slow to create predictions once trained. More accurate ensembles require more trees, which means using the model becomes slower. A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and use averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.

Fortunately, SVCs are effective in high dimensional spaces, even where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.

KNN is an instance based learning algorithm and therefore stores all data in memory. SVCs use a subset of training points in the decision function, so it is also memory efficient. Using a memory efficient algorithm, such as SVC, will result in higher performance and less hardware resources will be required to process the data, resulting in a reduction of operating cost. "

    "Intuitively, a good dividing line is acheived by the creating the greatest distance between training-data of different classes. In doing so we are making the least commitment to the data, lowering the generalization error and thus avoiding overfitting. This is exactly how SVMs work, by defining a linear separator (or hyperplane) that maximizing these margins between data of different classifications. Quadratic programming is a special type of mathematical optimization problem used by the SVM to find these maximum margins. \n",
    "\n",
    "The training-data nearest to the margins are more relevant in defining the hyperplane. This is the subset of training points the SVM uses in the decision function, called support vectors. Since the SVM uses a subset of the training data it is a memory efficient algorithm. SVMs also use different \"kernels\" to perform feature transformations on the data in order to find separations in higher dimensional space, thus SVMs are less susceptible to the curse of dimensionality than other algorithms.
